Helios C2 Demo UI
=================

This lightweight demo UI lets you navigate the key pipeline concerns:

- Dashboard: high-level counters and timings (real metrics file driven)
- Approvals: shows approval defaults per action and their enforcement status (real)
- Guardrails: shows per-asset and pattern-based rate limits (real)
- Infra Effector: shows file/HTTP export status with mock send (mocked HTTP)

Each page indicates whether data is live or mock and describes intended behavior.

Run locally
-----------

```
python -m http.server 8080 -d ui
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Data sources
------------

- metrics.prom: generated by the pipeline when `pipeline.export.formats` includes `metrics`.
- approvals/guardrails pages read from `configs/default.yaml` to display configured defaults.
- infra effector page provides a mock HTTP trigger; no real external calls are made.
